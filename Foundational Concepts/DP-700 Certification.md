        **Audience profile**
        
        As a candidate for this exam, you should have subject matter expertise with data loading patterns, data architectures, and orchestration processes. Your responsibilities for this role include:
        
        - Ingesting and transforming data.
        - Securing and managing an analytics solution.
        - Monitoring and optimizing an analytics solution.
        
        You work closely with analytics engineers, architects, analysts, and administrators to design and deploy data engineering solutions for analytics.
        
        You should be skilled at manipulating and transforming data by using Structured Query Language (SQL), PySpark, and Kusto Query Language (KQL).
