Transforming data is the heart of any analytics platform. Microsoft Fabric provides a "multi-language" experience, allowing you to use the best tool for the job. The three primary languages for data transformation are **PySpark**, **T-SQL**, and **KQL**.

This guide will provide a comprehensive comparison and walkthrough of how to perform common data transformations using each of these languages, highlighting their strengths and ideal use cases.

### The Core Concept: A Multi-Engine Platform

Fabric is built on the principle of separating compute from storage. The data lives in **OneLake** in the Delta Parquet format, and different compute engines can operate on that same data.

*   **PySpark (Spark Engine):** Operates on data in a **Lakehouse**. It's the most versatile and powerful tool for large-scale data engineering and data science.
*   **T-SQL (SQL Engine):** Operates on data in a **Data Warehouse** or via the **SQL Analytics Endpoint** of a Lakehouse. It's the standard for relational data modeling and BI.
*   **KQL (Kusto Engine):** Operates on data in a **KQL Database**. It's purpose-built for ultra-fast querying of time-series, log, and telemetry data.

### Case Study: E-Commerce Sales Data Transformation

Let's use a consistent dataset to see how each language tackles the same transformation tasks.

**Source Data:** A table named `Sales_Data` containing raw sales transactions.

| Timestamp | ClientIP | UserID | Product | Category | Quantity | UnitPrice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2023-11-18T10:00:05Z| 192.168.1.10 | user-101 | Laptop | Electronics | 1 | 1200 |
| 2023-11-18T10:02:15Z| 203.0.113.55 | user-102 | SQL Book | Books | 2 | 45 |
| 2023-11-18T10:05:30Z| 192.168.1.10 | user-101 | Mouse | Electronics | NULL | 25 |

**Transformation Goals:**
1.  **Cleansing:** Handle the `NULL` value in the `Quantity` column.
2.  **Enrichment:** Create a new column `TotalAmount` (`Quantity * UnitPrice`).
3.  **Filtering:** Select only the "Electronics" category.
4.  **Aggregation:** Calculate the total sales and number of orders for each user.

### 1. Transforming Data with PySpark (in a Notebook)

**Best for:** Large-scale ETL, complex data cleansing, machine learning feature engineering, and working with semi-structured or unstructured data.

```python
# In a Fabric Notebook attached to a Lakehouse
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, sum, count

# Load the data
df = spark.read.table("Sales_Data")

# 1. Cleansing: Fill null values in 'Quantity' with a default value of 1
df_cleaned = df.fillna(1, subset=["Quantity"])

# 2. Enrichment: Create the 'TotalAmount' column
df_enriched = df_cleaned.withColumn("TotalAmount", col("Quantity") * col("UnitPrice"))

# 3. Filtering: Select only 'Electronics'
df_filtered = df_enriched.filter(col("Category") == "Electronics")

# 4. Aggregation: Group by UserID and calculate aggregates
df_aggregated = df_filtered.groupBy("UserID").agg(
    sum("TotalAmount").alias("TotalSalesByUser"),
    count("ProductID").alias("NumberOfOrders")
)

# Display the final result
display(df_aggregated)
```

**Why PySpark excels here:**
*   **Expressiveness:** The code is highly readable and programmatic.
*   **Scalability:** This code will run efficiently on terabytes of data by distributing the work across the Spark cluster.
*   **Flexibility:** It can handle complex data types (nested JSON, arrays) and allows for custom logic with Python functions (UDFs), though built-in functions are preferred for performance.

### 2. Transforming Data with T-SQL (in a Warehouse or SQL Endpoint)

**Best for:** Relational data modeling, creating final BI-ready tables (star schemas), and tasks familiar to SQL developers and data analysts.

```sql
-- Run in a Data Warehouse or SQL Analytics Endpoint query editor

-- We can perform all steps in a single query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
WITH
CleansedData AS (
    -- 1. Cleansing: Handle NULLs using ISNULL or COALESCE
    SELECT
        Timestamp,
        UserID,
        Product,
        Category,
        ISNULL(Quantity, 1) AS Quantity, -- If Quantity is NULL, use 1
        UnitPrice
    FROM
        Sales_Data
),
EnrichedData AS (
    -- 2. Enrichment: Create the 'TotalAmount' column
    SELECT
        *,
        (Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalAmount
    FROM
        CleansedData
),
FilteredData AS (
    -- 3. Filtering: Select only 'Electronics'
    SELECT *
    FROM EnrichedData
    WHERE
        Category = 'Electronics'
)
-- 4. Aggregation: Group by UserID and calculate aggregates
SELECT
    UserID,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSalesByUser,
    COUNT(Product) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM
    FilteredData
GROUP BY
    UserID;
```

**Why T-SQL excels here:**
*   **Declarative:** You declare *what* you want, and the SQL engine figures out the best way to do it.
*   **Familiarity:** It's the lingua franca of data analytics. Most data professionals know SQL.
*   **Set-Based Operations:** It is highly optimized for set-based operations like joins and aggregations on structured data.

### 3. Transforming Data with KQL (in a KQL Database)

**Best for:** Time-series analysis, log analytics, telemetry data, and finding patterns in sequential data. KQL's syntax is optimized for exploration and speed on this type of data.

```kql
// Run in a KQL Queryset
Sales_Data
// 1. Cleansing and 2. Enrichment can be done in one 'extend' operator
| extend
    Quantity = iff(isnull(Quantity), 1, Quantity), // Handle NULLs
    TotalAmount = Quantity * UnitPrice            // Create new column
// 3. Filtering: The 'where' operator
| where Category == "Electronics"
// 4. Aggregation: The 'summarize' operator is KQL's equivalent of GROUP BY
| summarize
    TotalSalesByUser = sum(TotalAmount),
    NumberOfOrders = count() // count() in KQL is like COUNT(*)
    by UserID
```

**Why KQL excels here:**
*   **Conciseness:** The syntax is extremely compact and pipe-based (`|`), making it very fast to write and iterate on exploratory queries.
*   **Time-Series Native:** KQL has a rich library of built-in functions for time-series analysis (e.g., `ago()`, `row_window_session()`, anomaly detection) that are much more complex to implement in SQL or Spark.
*   **Performance on Logs:** The Kusto engine is purpose-built for lightning-fast text search and pattern matching on massive volumes of semi-structured data.

**The Fabric "Superpower":** You don't have to choose just one. A typical advanced analytics solution in Fabric will use all three:
1.  **PySpark** to ingest and clean raw data from various sources into a Silver Lakehouse table.
2.  **T-SQL** in a Data Warehouse to access that Silver table and transform it into a Gold star schema for BI.
3.  **KQL** to analyze real-time streaming logs simultaneously for operational monitoring and alerting.
