### Case Study: Real-Time Retail Analytics

**Company:** *Global-Retail-Corp*, a large retailer with both online and physical stores.

**Objective:**
The business wants a real-time dashboard to monitor sales as they happen. Specifically, they need to:
1.  See a live count of sales and total revenue, updated every few seconds.
2.  Analyze sales trends by product category in near real-time.
3.  Enrich incoming sales data with store location details (e.g., city, state) for geographical analysis.
4.  Store all raw and enriched sales data in a durable, queryable format for historical analysis by data scientists.

**Data Sources:**
*   **Source 1 (Streaming):** Point-of-Sale (POS) systems from all stores send a JSON message for every transaction to an **Azure Event Hub**.
*   **Source 2 (Static):** A `Stores` dimension table in a Fabric Lakehouse contains store metadata (StoreID, City, State).

### End-to-End Design: The "Hot" and "Cold" Path Pattern

This is a classic and highly effective pattern for streaming architectures.

*   **Hot Path:** For immediate, real-time analytics and alerting. Data is processed with the lowest possible latency for live dashboards. **We will use a KQL Database for this.**
*   **Cold Path:** For durable storage, complex transformations, and historical/batch analytics. Data is stored in a scalable, cost-effective format. **We will use a Lakehouse for this.**

Fabric's unified nature makes this pattern exceptionally easy to implement.

                                                    |

                                                                                   |
                                                                                   v
                                                                           [Power BI Report]
                                                                           (DirectLake Mode)
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation in Microsoft Fabric

#### Step 1: Set up the Ingestion Hub (Fabric Eventstream)

1.  **Create an Eventstream:** In your Fabric workspace, create a new `Eventstream` artifact. Let's name it `ES_Sales_Transactions`.

2.  **Add a Source:**
    *   Click "Add external source".
    *   Select "Azure Event Hubs".
    *   Configure the connection to your company's Event Hub instance where the POS data is flowing. You'll need the namespace, event hub name, and appropriate credentials.
    *   The Eventstream will start capturing the incoming JSON data immediately. You can see a live preview of the data flowing in.

    *Example JSON message from the stream:*
    ```json
    {
      "TransactionID": "txn-abc-123",
      "Timestamp": "2023-11-16T14:35:12Z",
      "StoreID": 101,
      "ProductID": "prod-xyz-789",
      "Quantity": 1,
      "UnitPrice": 1200.00
    }
    ```

#### Step 2: Implement the Hot Path (KQL Database for Live Dashboards)

1.  **Create a KQL Database:** In the same workspace, create a new `KQL Database`. Name it `KQL_LiveSales`. Inside it, create a table called `LiveTransactions`.

2.  **Add a Destination to the Eventstream:**
    *   Go back to your `ES_Sales_Transactions` Eventstream.
    *   Click "Add destination".
    *   Select "KQL Database".
    *   Configure it to send the data to your `KQL_LiveSales` database and the `LiveTransactions` table.
    *   Fabric handles the data format conversion and ingestion automatically. The process is continuous and has sub-second latency.

3.  **Create a Real-Time Power BI Report:**
    *   Go to your `KQL_LiveSales` database.
    *   Click "New Power BI report".
    *   Fabric automatically creates a dataset connected to the KQL database in **DirectQuery** mode.
    *   Build your dashboard:
        *   Use a **Card** visual with `Count(TransactionID)` to show the live sales count.
        *   Use another **Card** visual with `Sum(UnitPrice * Quantity)` to show total revenue.
    *   Set the "Automatic page refresh" setting in Power BI to its fastest interval (e.g., every 1 second).

**Result:** You now have a live dashboard showing sales metrics updated in near real-time as transactions occur.

#### Step 3: Implement the Cold Path (Lakehouse for Storage and Enrichment)

1.  **Create a Lakehouse:** In the workspace, create a `Lakehouse` named `LH_Sales_Analytics`.

2.  **Add a Second Destination to the Eventstream:**
    *   Go back to your `ES_Sales_Transactions` Eventstream.
    *   Click "Add destination" again. This time, select "Lakehouse".
    *   Configure it to write the raw stream data into a new Delta table in your `LH_Sales_Analytics` Lakehouse. Name this table `Bronze_Transactions`.

    **Result:** All raw transaction data is now being durably stored in a `Bronze_Transactions` table in the Lakehouse, creating a permanent, historical record.

#### Step 4: Enrich the Data (The "Bronze to Silver" Transformation)

This is where we add the store location details. We will use a Spark Notebook to join the streaming data with our static dimension table.

1.  **Create the Static Dimension Table:**
    *   In your `LH_Sales_Analytics` Lakehouse, create a table named `Dim_Stores`. You can upload a CSV or create it manually.
    *Example Data for `Dim_Stores`:*
    | StoreID | City | State |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | 101 | New York | NY |
    | 102 | London | UK |
    | 103 | Tokyo | JP |

2.  **Create a Notebook for Transformation:**
    *   In the workspace, create a new `Notebook`. Attach it to your `LH_Sales_Analytics` Lakehouse.
    *   Write the following PySpark code. This code performs a **micro-batch stream-to-stream join**; it reads the incoming bronze data as a stream and joins it with the static store dimension table.

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import col, from_json
    from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType, DoubleType, TimestampType

    # --- 1. Load the static dimension table ---
    df_stores = spark.read.table("LH_Sales_Analytics.Dim_Stores")

    # --- 2. Read the raw bronze data as a stream ---
    # The Eventstream writes data as a JSON string in a 'body' column. We need to parse it.
    df_bronze_stream = spark.readStream.table("LH_Sales_Analytics.Bronze_Transactions")

    # Define the schema of the incoming JSON
    json_schema = StructType([
        StructField("TransactionID", StringType(), True),
        StructField("Timestamp", TimestampType(), True),
        StructField("StoreID", IntegerType(), True),
        StructField("ProductID", StringType(), True),
        StructField("Quantity", IntegerType(), True),
        StructField("UnitPrice", DoubleType(), True)
    ])

    # Parse the JSON string and select the fields
    df_parsed_stream = df_bronze_stream.select(from_json(col("body").cast("string"), json_schema).alias("data")).select("data.*")

    # --- 3. Enrich the stream by joining with the static table ---
    df_enriched_stream = df_parsed_stream.join(
        df_stores,
        df_parsed_stream.StoreID == df_stores.StoreID,
        "left_outer"  # Use left outer join to not lose sales data if a store is missing
    ).drop(df_stores.StoreID) # Drop the duplicate key

    # --- 4. Write the enriched stream to a new "Silver" Delta table ---
    # This will continuously process new data from Bronze and append it to Silver.
    query = (df_enriched_stream.writeStream
             .format("delta")
             .outputMode("append")
             .option("checkpointLocation", "/lakehouse/default/checkpoints/silver_transactions_checkpoint") # Crucial for fault tolerance
             .trigger(availableNow=True) # Process all available data in a micro-batch and then stop, or use .trigger(processingTime='1 minute') for continuous runs.
             .toTable("LH_Sales_Analytics.Silver_Sales_Enriched")
            )
    
    # To run this continuously, you would schedule this notebook in a Fabric Pipeline.
    ```

3.  **Schedule the Notebook:** Create a Fabric Data Pipeline and schedule this notebook to run every few minutes to continuously process new data from the Bronze table to the Silver table.

**Result:** You now have a `Silver_Sales_Enriched` table in your Lakehouse that contains both the transaction data and the corresponding store's city and state. This table is clean, enriched, and ready for deep analysis. Data scientists can now use this table to analyze sales by region without performing joins.

### Summary of the Loading Pattern

1.  **Capture Raw:** Use **Eventstream** to capture all streaming data and immediately fork it into two paths.
2.  **Hot Path (Real-Time View):** Send raw data directly to a **KQL Database**. This provides sub-second latency for live dashboards in Power BI (using DirectQuery). This is for *what is happening right now*.
3.  **Cold Path (Durable Storage):** Send raw data to a **Lakehouse Bronze table**. This ensures no data is ever lost and provides a cheap, scalable historical archive.
4.  **Enrich and Transform:** Use a **Spark Notebook** to read from the Bronze table, join it with dimension tables, and write the result to a **Silver table**. This is for creating a clean, queryable dataset for business analysts and data scientists.
5.  **Historical Analysis:** Connect Power BI to the **Silver table** in the Lakehouse using **DirectLake mode** for incredibly fast performance on historical data.

This pattern gives you the best of both worlds: blazing-fast real-time insights and a robust, scalable platform for deep historical analysis, all within a single, unified environment.
