Deployment pipelines represent the disciplined progression of work from possibility to reliability. You begin in development, where ideas are raw and untested. You advance to testing, where those ideas are subjected to constraint and scrutiny. Only after they survive that ordeal are they allowed into production, the domain where real consequences exist.

This movement from dev to test to prod is not arbitrary. It mirrors the way any responsible system grows: through incremental exposure to challenge. Fabric’s built-in pipelines formalize that journey so the transition from intention to action remains stable, predictable, and trustworthy.
